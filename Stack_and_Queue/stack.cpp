/*
 * Implementation of Stack in C++
 *
 * A stack uses LIFO (last-in first-out) ordering.
 * That is, as in a stack of dinner plates, the most recent
 * item added to the stack is the first item to be removed.
 *
 * Following operations are included in the Stack -
 *
 * pop() : Remove the top item from the stack.
 * push(item) : Add an item to the top of the stack.
 * peek() : Return the top of the stack.
Â * isEmpty() : Return true if and only if the stack is empty.
