/*
 * Implementation of Queue in C++
 *
 * A queue implements FIFO (first-in first-out) ordering.
 * As in a line or queue at a ticket stand, items are removed
 * from the data structure in the same order that they are added.
 *
 * Following operations are included in the Queue -
 *
 * add(item): Add an item to the end of the list.
 * remove(): Remove the first item in the list.
 * peek() : Return the top of the queue.
Â * isEmpty() : Return true if and only if the queue is empty.
